# 🛤️ Analysis of Appraisal: IRCTC Tourism Packages using Statistical Tools

This project analyzes IRCTC tourism packages using Python and statistical techniques. It explores customer satisfaction, pricing trends, and category-based performance using real-world-inspired data.

---

## 📌 Objective

To evaluate IRCTC tourism packages using statistical methods such as:
- Descriptive statistics
- Regression analysis
- ANOVA
- Hypothesis testing
- Data visualization

---

## 📁 Dataset

A sample dataset (`irctc_tour_packages.csv`) includes:
- Package Name
- Destination
- Price
- Duration (days)
- Customer Rating (1–5)
- Review Count
- Tour Category (Religious, Historical, Leisure, etc.)

> 🔹 *Note: This is a sample dataset created for analysis purposes.*

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python (Google Colab)**
- `pandas` – data handling
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – visualizations
- `scikit-learn` – regression
- `scipy` – statistical testing

---

## 📈 Statistical Methods Applied

1. **Descriptive Statistics** – Mean, Median, Std. Dev.
2. **Regression Analysis** – Rating vs Price
3. **ANOVA** – Compare ratings across categories
4. **Hypothesis Testing** – Is avg. rating > 4?
5. **Visualizations** – Bar charts, pie charts, histograms, box plots

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Leisure and Nature tours** scored the highest in customer satisfaction.
- **Price and rating** had a weak linear relationship.
- **Tour categories** had statistically significant differences in rating (ANOVA).
- Suggests improving lower-rated categories and focusing on high-rated ones.
